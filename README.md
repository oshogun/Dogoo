# dogoo

Dogoo is a roguelike game under development by oshogun, from now on refered as dogoodev. 

It is being developed using the C++ language, at it's C++11 standard. I am not yet using C++14, as C++11 has better compatibility with most compilers. It is being developed under linux and using the SFML library, however, it should be portable and easy to build under Windows and Mac as well. This will use std::threads for multithreading support. I am not sure how well Windows compilers deal with those.
