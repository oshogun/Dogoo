<p>Computers proccess data, which are effectively the manipulation of electric signals that are abstracted in such a way that they can represent 
meaningful information. The human brain effectively does the same. Those signals of course are meaningless unless there's a *processor*
that is capable of give them meaning. But what if it was possible to backup all the data that represent's a person's conscience to a computer?</p>

<p>What if science knew enough about the human brain so that a processor capable of working exactly like a brain could be developed? Would 
that be a means to achieve immortality? Would the new conscience, now living inside a machine, be the same person as the original? Or
just an exact copy? </p>
<p>
These questions are brought into light in this epic sci-fi fantasy adventure roguelike, under development by Doggo Software studios.</p>
